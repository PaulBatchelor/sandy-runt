.SH DESCRIPTION
sandy is a simple ncurses Text Editor. It loads and saves files and lets you perform basic editing and pipe the selection through arbitrary commands. A small degree of external control can be achieved by writing to a named pipe.

.SH USAGE
The default key-bindings try to stick to the "emacs-mode" present in modern shells (specifically mksh(1)), ignoring binding chains and replacing or removing all meta bindings. External input is handled using dmenu(1) if the DISPLAY environment variable is set, read using sh(1) otherwise. Similarly, X11 clipboard interaction occurs through xsel(1) if DISPLAY is set, using a hidden file in the HOME directory otherwise.
